<h1>Welcome to the BitQuest wiki!</h1>
<p>Here, you can learn all about BitQuest, the first Minecraft server with a Bitcoin-denominated economy. Please remember that this server is still under development, so check this wiki frequently to stay up-to-date with changing mechanics.</p>
<p>To get started, you can take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/bitquest/bitquest/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a> page. For more information about BitQuest's community, mechanics, and development, read the following:</p>
<h2>The BitQuest Community</h2>
<p>BitQuest started as an experiment of what creating a game with an economy based off a real currency could do. Of course, at the center of any economy is the community, and BitQuest has created an interesting one.</p>
<p>The easiest way to get involved is to join BitQuest's server via <a href="https://minecraft.net/en-us/download/">Minecraft 1.13.2</a> with the address, <code>play.bitquest.co</code> (for Bitcoin server) or <code>play.bitquest.co</code> (for Dogecoin)</p>
<p>You can also <a href="https://discord.gg/jvJ624c">join BitQuest's Discord server</a> to get the latest community news and talk to other BitQuest players.</p>
<p>BitQuest doesn't filter its chat, but in case of proof of abusive chat, some users should be banned. </p>
